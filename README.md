## How It Works

### Technology Behind Privacy
Amar Taka uses browser-based **IndexedDB** to store all your data locally on your device. When you add a transaction, it's saved directly to your browser's local storage - not sent to any server. Even if you're offline, everything works perfectly because there's no server dependency.

2. **Add your first transaction** by tapping the + button

4. **Start tracking** - the app auto-saves everything locally

### Daily Usage

- **Home Dashboard**: View your current balance, recent transactions, and spending overview
- **Analysis Page**: Check detailed charts and patterns to understand your finances
- **Budget Monitor**: Track your spending against your budget in real-time

### Data Safety
Your data is **automatically saved** to your device with every action. For additional safety:
- **Regular Backups**: Go to Settings → Backup & Restore → Export Data
- **Easy Restore**: Import your backup file anytime to restore all data
- **No Account Login**: Your data can't be hacked because it never leaves your device
